# **Integrated RAG System ‚Äì Local LLMs with Up-to-Date Knowledge**

This project is designed to **bridge the gap between locally run LLMs and real-time web knowledge**. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on outdated static datasets, this **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** dynamically searches the web, extracts relevant information, and enhances LLM responses with fresh, up-to-date context‚Äîall while running entirely **on your local machine**.

## **Why This Matters**
Most LLMs are limited to the knowledge they were trained on. This system **eliminates that constraint** by:
‚úÖ **Fetching the latest data from the web** instead of relying on old training sets.  
‚úÖ **Running fully locally**‚Äîno need for cloud-based APIs or external dependencies.  
‚úÖ **Combining powerful search & retrieval** with AI-driven answers.  

## **How It Works**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Finds the Best Sources** ‚Äì Uses **Google Custom Search API** to locate relevant articles.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Extracts Clean Data** ‚Äì Scrapes text from web pages & PDFs, removing ads and clutter.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Processes & Organizes Content** ‚Äì Chunks and embeds text for fast retrieval.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Stores Knowledge Locally** ‚Äì Saves extracted data in **ChromaDB**, a local vector database.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Enhances Your Local LLM** ‚Äì Uses **retrieved context** to generate accurate, up-to-date answers.  

## **Key Features**
üöÄ **Run LLMs with current data** ‚Äì Keep your AI informed without retraining.  
üîç **Web-enhanced question answering** ‚Äì Get **real-time, reliable answers** from local models.  
üìÇ **Works with documents** ‚Äì Scrapes and processes PDFs & webpages.  
üíæ **Fully Local & Privacy-Friendly** ‚Äì Your data stays on your machine.  
üí° **Optimized for lightweight models** ‚Äì Works with **TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat**, but adaptable to others.  

## **Installation**
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Google Custom Search API Key (for web search)
- Required Python libraries

### **Setup**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prajvinsharan/integrated-rag-system.git
   cd integrated-rag-system
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
   export GOOGLE_CSE_ID="your_custom_search_engine_id"
   ```

## **Usage**
To **search the web and get an AI-generated answer**:
```bash
python main.py --query "What is thrombosis?"
```

To **query locally stored knowledge without searching the web**:
```bash
python main.py --query "What is thrombosis?" --skip-search
```

## **Under the Hood**
- **Google Search API** ‚Äì Finds relevant web sources  
- **Playwright & BeautifulSoup** ‚Äì Extracts clean text from web pages  
- **PyPDF2** ‚Äì Parses PDFs for additional knowledge  
- **ChromaDB** ‚Äì Stores and retrieves contextual information locally  
- **SentenceTransformers** ‚Äì Finds the most relevant data using embeddings  
- **TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat** ‚Äì Provides AI-generated answers with context-aware retrieval  

## **Who Is This For?**
‚úîÔ∏è Developers who want to **enhance their LLMs with real-time data**  
‚úîÔ∏è Researchers who need **accurate, up-to-date insights**  
‚úîÔ∏è Privacy-conscious users who prefer **local AI processing**

## Why Some Websites Were Not Scraped

In the sample output above, you‚Äôll notice that one website (`https://www.icc-cricket.com/tournaments/champions-trophy-2025/news/official-fixtures-announced-for-icc-champions-trophy-2025`) was skipped, as indicated by the messages "‚ùå Skipping invalid page" and "‚ùå Failed to scrape." This happens because the system respects the `robots.txt` file of websites. The `robots.txt` file is a standard used by website owners to instruct web crawlers and scrapers about which parts of the site they are allowed to access. If a website‚Äôs `robots.txt` disallows scraping for certain pages or the entire site, the system skips those pages to comply with these restrictions. This ensures ethical scraping practices and adherence to the website‚Äôs policies.
